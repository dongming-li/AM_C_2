General Git Procedure

Any time you want to write or edit code, just switch to your branch using:
$ git checkout <your-branch>

Do a pull to update your copy of the project:
$ git pull

<Do stuff here>

After making your changes on the files, run commit on all files:
$ git commit -a -m "MY MESSAGE HERE"

Then Push your final changes

$ git push -u origin <your-branch>


Then switch back to master with:
$ git checkout master

Then to ensure that your version of master is the same as the repositories:
$ git pull


Then do:
$ git merge <your-branch>

And then push:
$ git push -u origin master

That should be all you need to do from start of editing to being done editing, any merge problems that surface should give you the change to fix them in the terminal.

And remember, if things break, you can revert to a previous state to recove lost work. But only if you are commiting.
