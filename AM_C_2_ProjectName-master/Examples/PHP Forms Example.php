	/* This example aims to demonstrate a method of handling HTML form data with PHP 																	*/
	/* NOTE: The core concepts and some key bits of syntax are the important part of this example. This can probably be parsed and executed, though.	*/

	//In this example, the HTML form is first created using the PHP Heredoc syntax, as follows:
	$form = <<< HTML
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
			<head>
				<title> Example Form </title>
			<head>
			<body>
				<form action=''
			</body>
		</html>
HTML;
